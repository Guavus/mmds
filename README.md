# Model Management and Deployment Service

MMDS is a collaborative tool for developing, validating, distributing and retiring AI / ML models. This tool is a collection of service and user interface. This tool is implemented as a CDAP application. 

## Why is MMDS required ?

As AI / ML is being democratized, an important part of any AI or ML process is the model that is generated either to predict or classify the target function. Multiple iterations, different experimentation, varied features used to build the model have to be systematically tracked. The Model management involves a collaborative team of modelers, architects, scoring officers, model auditors and validation testers. Many enterprises are struggling with the process of signing off on the development, validation, deployment, and retirement life cycle management. They need to readily know exactly where each model is in the life cycle, how old the model is, who developed the model, and who is using the model for what application.The ability to version-control the model over time is another critical business need which includes event logging and tracking changes to understand how the model form and usage is evolving over time.

Model decay is another serious challenge faced by organizations. Metrics are needed to determine when a model needs to be refreshed or replaced. Retired models also need to be archived. More reliable management of the score repositories is also a key requirement to ensure that quality representative data is available to evaluate model performance and profitability over time.
